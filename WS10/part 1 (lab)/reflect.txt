This workshop was about templates and after doing this workshop I feel pretty confident about that, I get used to do the template implementations. The main struggle was in 
implementing the main model (passing the arguments in parameters) cause I've been getting confused while passing the parameters in function. Overall, this workshop was light,
it took me less than 25 minutes I guess and I want to thank you for providing us the clear and instructive workshops. By doing those workshops, many students would feel confident 
on the finals. Templates are a fundamental feature of C++ that enable generic programming, code reusability, and metaprogramming. 
While they can be complex and sometimes lead to difficult-to-debug errors, mastering templates is essential for writing efficient and flexible C++ code.
