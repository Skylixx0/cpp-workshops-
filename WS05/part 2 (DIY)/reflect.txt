This workshop was pretty hard for me as there are a lot of concepts associated with overloading operators, such as 
operator +=, operator++, etc. The main struggle was in operator += as it has the dynamic allocation memory, which was
painful for me because there are a lot of informations that have to be stored in my head. So, 
the overloading operators should not be modifier for object's state nor should be the query cause the query's
main purpose is to receive data (object's state) without modifying it but comparison operators (operator +=, operator > etc.)
does not have the current object instance at all, it is located in global scope which have nothing to do with class.
